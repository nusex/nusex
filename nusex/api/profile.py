class Profile:
    """A class representing a profile.

    All keyword arguments are different attributes which nusex will use
    when deploying templates. They all default to :obj:`None` if not
    passed.

    Args:
        name (:obj:`str`):
            The name of the profile.

    Keyword Arguments:
        author_name (:obj:`str` | :obj:`None`):
            The name with which you wish to be attributed in new
            projects. This should be your real name, a nickname, or your
            organisation's name.
        author_nick (:obj:`str` | :obj:`None`):
            The username you normally use for services related to your
            development projects.
        author_email (:obj:`str` | :obj:`None`):
            The email address through which users can contact you or
            your organisation.
        preferred_language (:obj:`str` | :obj:`None`):
            The language you would normally be developing with when
            using this profile.
        preferred_license (:obj:`str` | :obj:`None`):
            The license you would normally use when using this profile.
            When deploying a template nusex will use this as a key, and
            attempt to resolve it against a list of open-source
            licenses.
        starting_version (:obj:`str` | :obj:`None`):
            The version to deploy templates with. By default nusex will
            use this value as-is, but if you set this to "CALVER" nusex
            will use the current date in YYYY.MM.DD format when
            deploying the template.
        version_control_url (:obj:`str` | :obj:`None`):
            The URL of your version control host (i.e. GitHub),
            including your username. By default nusex will append the
            name of the project to the end of this URL when deploying,
            but you can override this behaviour by including
            "PROJECTNAME" anywhere in this URL.
        docs_url (:obj:`str` | :obj:`None`):
            The URL of the documentation hosting service you normally
            use. Different documentation hosting services handle URLs
            differently -- by default nusex will append the name of the
            project to the end of the URL, but you can override this
            behaviour by inserting "PROJECTNAME" anywhere in the URL. If
            you use ReadTheDocs for example, you will need to do this.
        ci_url (:obj:`str` | :obj:`None`):
            The URL of the continuous integration suite you normally
            use. By default nusex will append the name of the project to
            the end of this URL when deploying, but you can override
            this behaviour by including "PROJECTNAME" anywhere in this
            URL.
